What is JavaScript?

JS is a programming language. We use it to give instructions to the computer.

input(code)->computer->output

Our 1st JS Code

Console.log is used to log (print) a message to the console

console.log("Apna College");

create a html file and connect JavaScript to it 

inspect the browser and go to console to see your code output

variables in JS

variables are containers for data

In console - age=24 #24
             age #24
             age+1#25

             name="tony shark" #tony shark

             price=150.50 #150.5

             x=null # know wt is inside but its empty

             y=undefined # dont know wt is inside it

Js is dynamically typed langauage - doesnt need to specify its type in advanced like java or c

Variable Rules

* Variable names are case sensitive; "a" & "A" is different.(ex-FullName and fullName are different )

* Only letters(fullname), digits(fn123), underscore(f_n)(_fn) and $ is allowed. (not even space)

* Only a letter, underscore(_) or $ should be 1st character.

* Reserved words cannot be variable names.

let, const & var

* var: Variable can be re-declared & updated. A global scope variable.

* let: Variable cannot be re-declared but can be updated. A block scope variable.
cannot define let more than once in a block of code

* const: Variable cannot be re-declared or updated. A block scope variable.
const cannot be modified but in collection of values const obj->key can be modifies 

Data Types in JS

Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, BigInt, Symbol

typeof variable_name; # to check type of variable

* Primitive (7)

* Non-primitive - Objects(arrays,functions)-collection of values
ex- student -> name(string)
               age(number)
               marks(number)
               ispass(boolean)
